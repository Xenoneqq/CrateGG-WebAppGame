# CRATE.GG - MarketPlace WebApp
A web app where users can buy and sell items in a community-driven marketplace.

## About
CRATE.GG is a marketplace for trading crates (rare collectible items). The goal is to collect as many rare crates as possible through trading and a risk-based unboxing system. The app is designed to simulate an environment similar to the Steam Marketplace.

**ðŸ‘¤ User Storage**

Each player, upon logging in, receives a dedicated storage page that can be viewed by other users. The storage page contains all the crates collected by the user and indicates whether any crate is currently listed on the marketplace.

**ðŸ’¸ Marketplace**

A community-driven marketplace where users can trade their crates for in-game currency. This currency can then be used to purchase better or rarer crates.

**ðŸ“¦ Crates**

Crates are collectible items that can be opened, with a chance to obtain better crates at the risk of losing the one being opened. Each crate is defined by the following attributes:

- **Name** â€“ Used to differentiate one crate from another.
- **Pattern** â€“ Each crate is assigned a random pattern number, which determines its design. Some patterns are exceptionally rare.
- **Rarity** â€“ Defines how difficult the crate is to obtain. The rarer the crate, the harder it is to acquire through openings.
